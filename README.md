This Log Analysis Project is a lightweight and efficient tool for processing and analyzing web server log files, designed with scalability and usability in mind. The script avoids external parsing libraries, relying on Python's built-in regular expressions (re) for extracting IP addresses, endpoints, and detecting failed login attempts. This ensures portability and optimized performance, especially for handling large log files. The tool provides comprehensive analysis, including per-IP request counts, identification of the most frequently accessed endpoint, and detection of suspicious activity based on customizable failed login thresholds. Results are presented in a structured and user-friendly manner: detailed outputs in the terminal and a downloadable CSV file formatted to specified requirements. With a modular design, adherence to Python best practices, and an integration-friendly approach for environments like Jupyter Notebook, this project offers a robust and scalable solution for log file analysis while maintaining clear, well-documented, and maintainable code.
